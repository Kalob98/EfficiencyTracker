# EfficiencyTracker
JavaFX application that tracks the amount of items a user creates and calculates their efficiency.

## Employees
An employee is taken to a counter page where they click a plus button to count the number of items they have created or a minus button for any mistakes they made. There is also an efficiency page where an employee can look at their efficiecy for the day, week, or month. If their efficiency is greater than 90% the percentage will be green, however if it is lower than 90% it will be red.

## Manager
A manager is able to see each users day, week, and month efficiency on the managers home page. They can then switch to a weekly view and look at a user total amount of items made on any day of the week and their efficiency for that day. If their efficiency is greater than 90% the percentage will be green, however if it is lower than 90% it will be red.
